# 💫 About Me:
### 👋 Elevator Pitch  
Hi, I’m Arsenii, a 20-year-old software engineer and student at CUNY City College. I’m passionate about coding, solving real-world problems, and creating efficient and user-friendly software. Currently, I’m working on a typing game project called TurboType and exploring new ways to integrate AI into my applications.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On  
I’m building a portfolio of projects, such as my TurboType game, which is aimed at enhancing typing speed and accuracy. I’m also focused on improving my web development skills using React, Node.js, and SQL, and diving deeper into AI-driven software solutions.

### 🤝 Leadership and Community  
While I’m deeply invested in personal projects, I also believe in the power of community and leadership. I’ve previously helped organize tech meetups and events, and I’m eager to continue growing both as a developer and as a leader in the tech community.

### 📅 What’s Next?  
I’m continuously working on refining my skills in C++, web development, and AI. Next on the list is expanding my GitHub with more projects, contributing to open source, and collaborating with other developers on exciting new ideas.

### 🏓 Beyond the Code  
When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me staying active or reading up on the latest tech trends. Let’s talk about AI, coding challenges, or anything tech-related!
